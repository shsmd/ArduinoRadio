# ArduinoRadioClock
Arduino project on constructing a radio
Implemented a 2.8' TFT Adafruit Touchscreen with a RTC clock as well as IR remote to tune to different radio channels or change volume wirelessly
You can build your own audio amplifier to have better control on what you want such as bass/acoustic/stereo etc 
If you will have to go through the steps on making the pre-amplifier(op-amps), tone control(bandpass filter) and a bridge amplifier as a nice start
(I used an off the shelf speaker module for ease)
