# ArduinoRadioClock
Arduino project on constructing a radio

Implemented a 2.8' TFT Adafruit Touchscreen with a RTC clock as well as IR remote to tune to different radio channels or change volume wirelessly

You can build your own audio amplifier to have better control on what you want such as bass/acoustic/stereo etc 

To do this, think about using:
- the pre-amplifier(op-amps)
- tone control(bandpass filter)
- bridge amplifier

(I used an off the shelf speaker module for ease)
